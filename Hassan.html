        <h2>Hassan</h2>
        <div class="breed-content">
            <p>Hassan sheep are a notable breed indigenous to the Hassan district of Karnataka, India, primarily raised for meat production. 
                These sheep are well-adapted to the local environment and play a significant role in the livelihoods of small and marginal farmers in the region. </p>

               <p> Adult male Hassan sheep have an average body length of 64.2 cm, a height at withers of 65.6 cm, and a chest girth of 74.3 cm, while females measure 
                slightly smaller, with a body length of 62.8 cm, height at withers of 63.7 cm, and chest girth of 72.1 cm. The tail length averages 12.5 cm in males and 11.2 cm in females.</p>

                <p>At birth, males weigh around 2.1 kg, while females weigh about 2.0 kg. By 3 months, males reach approximately 14.1 kg and females 13.4 kg. At 6 months,
                 males weigh 19.0 kg and females 17.7 kg. By one year, males average 25.7 kg, while females weigh about 23.3 kg. Fully grown adult males can weigh between 
                 24-65 kg, with an average of 42.8 kg, whereas females weigh between 16-50 kg, averaging 31.8 kg.</p>
                
                <p>Hassan sheep have a lambing rate of approximately 64%, with an average lambing interval of 12 months. They are primarily managed under semi-intensive 
                grazing systems, with many shepherds providing closed, kutcha-type sheds for housing. Sheep are grazed throughout the year, typically migrating within
                 a 50 km radius. Common health management practices include regular deworming and vaccinations.</p>
                
                <p>Under intensive feeding conditions, Hassan sheep lambs can grow at a rate of around 100 grams per day. For optimal meat yield, they are typically slaughtered
                 between 12-15 months of age.</p>
