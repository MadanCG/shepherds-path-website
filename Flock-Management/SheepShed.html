    <h3>General Considerations for Sheep Housing</h3>

      </div>
    </div>

    <ul>
      <li>
        Provision of simple sheds with low-cost materials is sufficient for
        sheep housing.
      </li>
      <li>
        Sheds with mud floors are suitable except in areas with high rainfall.
      </li>
      <li>
        Construct sheds in an elevated area to prevent water stagnation.
      </li>
      <li>Fodder trees around the shed can act as a source of feed.</li>
      <li>Clean drinking water must be available.</li>
      <li>Proper ventilation is essential for sheds.</li>
      <li>Walls of the shed should be free from cracks and holes.</li>
      <li>Floors should be firm and capable of absorbing water.</li>
      <li>Types of sheds depend on the rearing system.</li>
      <li>Open-type housing with covered areas and run space is ideal.</li>
      <li>The run space should be covered by chain links.</li>
      <li>East-west orientation with good ventilation is preferred.</li>
      <li>
        Thatched roofs are cost-effective, but asbestos sheets provide
        durability.
      </li>
      <li>Gable roofing is generally preferred for better airflow.</li>
      <li>
        Height of sheds should be around 2.5m, with ridge height at 3.5m.
      </li>
      <li>Separate feeders and water troughs should be provided.</li>
    </ul>
