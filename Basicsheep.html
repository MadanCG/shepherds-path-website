        <h3>Sheep as a Species</h3>
        <p>Ovis aries, or sheep, are a ruminant mammal, and there are currently just over a billion domesticated sheep kept as pets and livestock around the world. Most people believe that the modern domesticated sheep breeds are descended from the mouflon.</p>
        <p>Today, farmers raise sheep for wool, meat, their pelts, and even as dairy animals. Breeds like the East Persian are highly valued as dairy stock.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Wool is harvested through shearing.</li>
            <li>Meat and pelts are harvested by slaughtering the animal.</li>
            <li>Milk can be harvested by hand or with mechanical milking machines.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The general term for raising and caring for sheep is sheep husbandry, and this is practiced on farms throughout the world. If people live somewhere, chances are good that there are sheep nearby.</p>
        <h3>What Do Sheep Eat?</h3>
        <p>Whether you’re a new shepherd or you’re just curious and want to learn a little more about sheep food – it’s important to answer the question: “What do sheep eat?” Providing sheep with proper nutrition is the key to a thriving flock.</p>
        <p>Proper sheep nutrition must meet three key criteria:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Quantity.</li>
            <li>Quality.</li>
            <li>Balance.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>When do Sheep Graze and How Much Land Do You Need?</h3>
        <p>When do Sheep Graze and How Much Land Do You Need?</p>
        <p>A sheep will graze up to seven hours a day if the pasture is available. They prefer to eat in the cooler hours early in the morning and late in the afternoon. They will rarely explore their pasture after dark due to a fear of predation.</p>
        <p>Sheep are gregarious – a term which means they prefer to travel in a flock. It’s common to see your entire flock of sheep grazing together. They’ll eat grasses in one part of your pasture at a time, slowly moving together into new grasses.</p>
