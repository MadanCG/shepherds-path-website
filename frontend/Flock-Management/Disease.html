          Sheep can be affected by various diseases, including viral,
          bacterial, and parasitic infections. Common diseases include sheep
          pox, caseous lymphadenitis, coccidiosis, and blue tongue. Solutions
          include vaccination, hygiene, parasite control, and prompt
          veterinary care. .

          Sheep and goats are both small ruminants with cosmopolitan
          distributions due to their being kept historically and in modern
          times as grazers both individually and in herds in return for their
          production of milk, wool, and meat.[1] As such, the diseases of
          these animals are of great economic importance to humans.

      <h2>Symptoms & Diagnosis for common Disease of Sheep</h2>
      <p>
        Whether you have a sick sheep, a sick flock or are simply trying to
        learn about sheep health so that you can avoid common illnesses,
        our list of common sheep diseases is a useful resource which will help
        you identify symptoms and diagnose problems with the health of your
        flock.
      </p>

      <p>
        We have several “featured” sheep diseases and illnesses linked at the
        top of this page, and we’ve recently added a long alphabetical list of
        some of the most common diseases in sheep as well.

    <h2>Epidemiology:-</h2>

    Sheep-pox is a highly contagious disease. It causes a mortality of 20 to
    50 per cent in animals below the age of 6 months and causes damage to the
    wool and skin in adults. The disease is transmissible to other goats in
    contact, but not to other species of animals. It, however, spreads slowly.

    <h3>Symptoms:</h3>
    <p>
      The disease is characterised by high fever and symptoms of pneumonia and
      acute ente­ritis. Skin lesions appear particularly in parts free from
      wool, notably around the eyes, inner side of the thigh, udder and under
      surface of the tail.
    </p>
    <p>
      The inter­nal organs such as trachea, lungs, kidneys and inte­stine are
      also affected. The disease results in emacia­tion and, as already
      mentioned, frequent deaths of affected animals.
    </p>

    <h3>Treatment, Prevention and Control:</h3>
    <p>
      The disea­sed animal should be treated with palliatives. The infected
      litter should be burnt and the bedding changed every day. Affected
      animals should be kept on soft diet.
    </p>
    <p>
      The ulcers on the skin should be washed with potassium permanganate
      lotion and dusted with boric acid. Strict hygienic measures, like
      vaccination should be adopted. In about 15 to 20 days, the ani­mals
      become resistant to the disease.

    <h2>Brucellosis of Sheep:-</h2>
    <div class="housing-images">
      <div class="housing-item">

      </div>
    </div>
    <p>
      The mode of entry is by ingestion or via conjunctiva. The aborted
      foetus, vaginal discharge and milk from infected sheep contain a large
      number of organisms.
    </p>

    <h3>Symptoms</h3>
    :
    <p>
      In infected sheep, state of abortion may occur followed by a quiescent
      period during which a few abortions occur.
    </p>
    <p>
      The aborted animals do not breed. After 2 years or more another abortion
      storm is likely to occur.
    </p>

    <h3>Diagnosis, Treatment and Control:</h3>
    <p>
      It is not possible to diagnose brucellosis on the basis of symptoms
      alone. The suspicion is aroused when humans in contact suffer from
      undulant fever and there is poor breeding record in sheep herd and
      evidence of mastitis.
    </p>
    <p>
      The diagnosis can be done by the isolation of organisms and by
      serological tests. Treatment is based on proper hygiene, vaccina­tion,
      testing and disposal. Good management practice; essential.

    <h2>Tetanus:-</h2>
    <div class="housing-images">
      <div class="housing-item">
        <img src="../images/Flock-Management/Disease/tetanus.jpg" alt="disease" />
      </div>
    </div>
    <p>
      This is an infectious, non-febrile disease of ani­mals and men and is
      characterised by spasmodic tetany and hyperaesthesia. This disease is
      prevalent all over the world.
    </p>

    <h3>Transmission:</h3>
    <p>
      Infection takes place by conta­mination of wounds. Deep punctured wounds
      pro­vide favourable conditions for the spores to germi­nate, multiply
      and produce toxin which is subsequ­ently absorbed in the animal body.
    </p>
    <p>
      The micro­organism is present in soil and in animal faeces, and is
      carried into the wound by a penetrating object.
    </p>

    <h3>Symptoms:</h3>
    <p>
      Tetanus affects many species of domesticated animals but occurs
      particularly in horses and lambs; less frequently in adult sheep, goats,
      cattle, pigs, dogs and cats.
    </p>
    <p>
      The initial sym­ptoms are mild stiffness and an unwillingness to move.
    </p>
    <p>
      More severe symptoms develop after 12-24 hours of infection which are
      stiffness of limbs, neck, head, tail, and twitching of muscles.
      Mastication becomes very difficult because mouth cannot be opened, hence
      the name lockjaw.
    </p>

    <h3>Treatment:</h3>
    <p>
      The treatment is carried out by first injecting antitoxin, then treating
      the wound. Peni­cillin parenterally is beneficial.
    </p>
    <p>
      Muscular relaxation is achieved by injection of relaxants. The animal
      should be kept in a dark room and fed with the help of stomach tube.
