        <div class="breed-content">
            <p>Hassan sheep are a notable breed indigenous to the Hassan district of Karnataka, India, primarily raised
                for meat production.
                These sheep are well-adapted to the local environment and play a significant role in the livelihoods of
                small and marginal farmers in the region. </p>

            <p> Adult male Hassan sheep have an average body length of 64.2 cm, a height at withers of 65.6 cm, and a
                chest girth of 74.3 cm, while females measure
                slightly smaller, with a body length of 62.8 cm, height at withers of 63.7 cm, and chest girth of 72.1
                cm. The tail length averages 12.5 cm in males and 11.2 cm in females.</p>

            <p>At birth, males weigh around 2.1 kg, while females weigh about 2.0 kg. By 3 months, males reach
                approximately 14.1 kg and females 13.4 kg. At 6 months,
                males weigh 19.0 kg and females 17.7 kg. By one year, males average 25.7 kg, while females weigh about
                23.3 kg. Fully grown adult males can weigh between
                24-65 kg, with an average of 42.8 kg, whereas females weigh between 16-50 kg, averaging 31.8 kg.</p>

            <p>Hassan sheep have a lambing rate of approximately 64%, with an average lambing interval of 12 months.
                They are primarily managed under semi-intensive
                grazing systems, with many shepherds providing closed, kutcha-type sheds for housing. Sheep are grazed
                throughout the year, typically migrating within
                a 50 km radius. Common health management practices include regular deworming and vaccinations.</p>

            <p>Under intensive feeding conditions, Hassan sheep lambs can grow at a rate of around 100 grams per day.
                For optimal meat yield, they are typically slaughtered
                between 12-15 months of age.</p>
