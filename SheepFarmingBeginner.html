        <h3>Preparing to Own & Care for Sheep</h3>
        <p>
            Choosing the right breed of sheep for your farm is one of the biggest decisions you’ll need to make. But to do this, you’ll need to determine why you want to raise sheep. </p>
            <p>Do you want your sheep farm to be profitable? 
            
            Will it be a 4H flock for your child? Is it a hobby farm? Are you hoping to produce wool you can spin into yarn?</p>
        <h3> Best Sheep Breed for Beginners</h3>
        <p>All sheep are not alike and deciding on the type of sheep you want to raise is a big choice. There are literally dozens of breeds of sheep to choose from when choosing a breed for your farm.
             In this article I’ll share some of the best sheep breeds for beginners.
             I’ll also provide an overview of the different types of sheep that are available, so you can make an informed choice.</p>

            <p>That may seem like a strange question, but every type of sheep can serve a different purpose on your farm. Some breeds 
                produce excellent wool, some are big, rapid-gainers that are great for meat production. Each breed is different, so exploring why you want to have sheep will help guide you to the right breed..</p>
                <h3>Selecting and Buying Sheep</h3>
                <p>Rule number one: do not buy your breeding stock from a sale barn. I’m not saying you will never see a decent breeding ewe or ram at a sale barn. It’s what you don’t see at the sale barn that is the problem.</p>

                    <p>Sale barns are for selling market animals (those being sent to processors for meat production). The diseases and sicknesses of hundreds and thousands of animals (including parasites, foot rot, 
                        johnes and much more) are all alive and well in the sale barn.
                     This is NOT how you want to start out.</p>
                   <p> Instead, purchase your breeding stock from a producer in your region. You can easily go to a breed’s website and find a producer’s list as well as asking your local farm service agent or checking 
                    out the producer information with your state’s agriculture department.</p>
                    
                    <p>Select your animals based upon their body condition, their appearance (are they healthy and alert?), how well they will meet your needs and the condition of the farm you purchase them from. Ask to see production records if the farmer has them..</p>
        
         <h3>Managing Your Flock of Sheep</h3>
        <p>This is THE one thing that will make or break you in raising sheep.</p>
            <p>You can bring top-quality animals to your farm, but if do not manage them properly they will quickly go to poor-quality animals. Katahdins, for instance, are a low-maintenance hair sheep breed, but I cannot tell you how many times I have ‘preached’ the fact that low-maintenance does not mean no-maintenance.
