    <h3>Sheep as a Species</h3>
    <p>
      Sheep (called <i>Ovis aries</i>) are farm animals that chew their food more than once.
      They are soft, woolly animals that people raise for many uses. There are more than a billion sheep around the
      world.
      Most sheep today came from wild sheep called mouflon.
    </p>

    <p>
      Farmers keep sheep for their wool (hair), meat, milk, and skin. Some sheep are also used as pets or to keep grass
      short in big open spaces.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Wool:</strong> Used to make clothes like sweaters, socks, and blankets.</li>
      <li><strong>Meat:</strong> Lamb and mutton are two kinds of meat from sheep.</li>
      <li><strong>Milk:</strong> Used to make cheese and yogurt.</li>
      <li><strong>Skin:</strong> Used to make leather products.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Taking care of sheep is called sheep farming. It is common all over the world. Sheep can live in many kinds of
      weather and land.
    </p>

    <h3> What Do Sheep Eat?</h3>
    <p>
      Sheep mostly eat grass, hay, and plants. They need fresh, clean food every day.
      Giving sheep the right food helps them stay healthy and strong.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>They need <strong>enough food</strong> — not too little or too much.</li>
      <li>The food should be <strong>clean and fresh</strong>.</li>
      <li>The food should be <strong>balanced</strong> with all nutrients they need.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3> When Do Sheep Eat and How Much Space Do They Need?</h3>
    <p>
      Sheep eat for about seven hours a day if there's enough grass. They like to eat in the morning and evening when
      it's cool.
    </p>

    <p>
      Sheep move in groups called flocks. They walk together while eating and rest together too.
    </p>

      A small group of sheep needs a big open space (called a pasture) to walk and eat freely. One acre of land can
      usually feed 2 to 4 sheep.
    </p>
