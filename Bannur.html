            <p>The Bannur sheep or the Bandur sheep is specifically bred for its meat. Though the sheep are 
               small and gain weight slowly, their meat is considered to be a delicacy. The meat is famous in 
                Karnataka and neighboring states. The Bandur sheep meat has high-fat content when in 
                comparison to other sheep varieties. this is the reason for its taste and juiciness.</p>
            <p>While the meat of most sheep fetches is rs 300 in the market, the Bandur sheep meat is set at 
                500 during the same period. Bannur sheep are usually bred to be slaughtered during bakrid or 
                Ramzan. meat is also a common purchase during festivals and other occasions like weddings.
                When most meats are purchased in 1 kg or 2 kg, the Bannur sheep are usually purchased whole.</p> 
            <p>This adds a lot of value to the farmer as each sheep may fetch 20-25 thousand rupees and during the festive 
season, they are seen to sell for nearly 50,000 rs per sheep.
Farmers near the area of Bandur rely on the festive season to sell these sheep to the market and 
work a year long in raising these sheep for Bakrid. the biggest market for meat in recent years has 
been Bangalore where the price of meat has not been an issue and people have been purchasing 
the meat willingly and in large numbers.</p>
<p>The Bangalore market alone accounts for more than 75% of all Bannur sheep meat purchases in 
Karnataka as it has the highest buying potential. Farmers near the area benefit from the market in 
Bangalore and some farmers rely entirely on Bandur sheep farming for their livelihood.While the Bandur sheep aren’t as famous outside the state of Karnataka, farmers in Kerala, 
Tamil Nadu and Andhra are showing interest in the product and some enthusiasts have started 
farming these sheep in nearby states.</p>
<p>The sheep sell per kg and the does sell for up to 200 rs per kilo during the off-season while the 
buck sells for around 300-350 per kilo. The sheep used for breeding are selected based on their 
health and weight. 
Bucks are expected to be heavy-set and older than 6 months to be ready to mate.
Most sheep are slaughtered at the age of one year. The average weight of a sheep in one year 
is expected to be around 20 Kilos. Though not at its full weight, it is considered to be the best age 
for the sheep to be slaughtered for its taste.</p>
