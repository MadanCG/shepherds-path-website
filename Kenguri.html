        <h2>Kenguri</h2>
        <div class="breed-content">
            <p>The Kenguri is a breed of domestic sheep native to India . 
            It belongs to the South Indian hair breed group and is raised for its meat .</p>

            <h3>Origin and distribution</h3>
            <p>The Kenguri is native to northeastern Karnataka , mainly from the districts of Koppal and Raichur where it is
             well adapted to the aridity of the region .</p>
            
            <p>Its name comes from its color. It is based on the words kemp (red) and kuri (sheep) from the Kannada language . It is also known by various names such as Tenguri (from teng = coconut) but also Kangania, Keng, Kenga, Teng-Seemai, Tonguri, Yalag .
            
            The Indian government recognized the Kenguri as a breed in 2010.</p>
            
            <h3>Description</h3>
            <p>The Kenguri is a medium-sized sheep, covered with a generally red fleece. Some animals can be white, black or piebald. </p>
            <p>Breeders distinguish certain types of sheep according to the color of the coat. Thus, animals with a black belly are called 
            Jodka and those with a coat mixing black and brown are called Masaka . The ears are long (14  cm ) and the tail short (10  cm ). </p>
            <p>The ram weighs on average 52  kg for a height of 81  cm at the withers . The largest can reach 92  cm for 72  kg . The ewe weighs around 36  kg . 
                The male has horns of about 34  cm which can reach 48  cm . Females do not generally have them. In the rare ewes that do have them, they do not exceed 10  cm .</p>
            <h3>   Breeding and production</h3>
                    
            <p>Lambing takes place mainly between September and November. The ewe gives birth to a single lamb, twins are rare. The young weigh between 2.5 and 2.7  kg at birth.
                 The flocks graze in the morning and evening. In summer, during the hottest hours, the animals are sheltered to protect the young. The mortality rate among lambs is 8 to 10  % . A flock can travel up to 12 km in a day to look for food ( stubble , roadsides, etc.).</p>
            
            <p>The breed is raised primarily for its meat. Milk production is virtually non-existent. In cases where the lamb is stillborn or
             has been sold, the ewe is milked and the milk is used for personal consumption. It is rarely sold </p>

            <div class="characteristics-content">
                <p>Since the 1960s, the Kenguri population has been increasing.</p>
                 <p>Being able to provide more meat than other local breeds, the Kenguri experienced a craze in the early 21st century  and its breeding developed in the south of Karnataka. 
                 The animals are raised separately from other breeds and hybrid individuals remain rare .</p>

                <p>In 2007, the FAO classified the breed as "not threatened"</p>
