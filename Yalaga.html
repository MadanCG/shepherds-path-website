    <section class="breed-info">
        <h2>Yalaga</h2>
        <div class="breed-content">
            <p>Yalaga sheep are a distinctive breed indigenous to Karnataka, India, particularly prevalent in the
                Bagalkot district.
                They are characterized by their long legs, elongated necks, slender bodies, drooping hindquarters, and
                short tails. These sheep are renowned for producing high-quality mutton. </p>

            <h4>Distribution and Habitat</h4>

            <p>Yalaga sheep are primarily found in the Bagalkot district, encompassing talukas such as Bagalkot, Bilagi,
                Badami, and Hungund. The region's climate is semi-arid, with an average annual rainfall of about 579 mm.
                The terrain is predominantly dry, with agriculture focusing on crops like jowar, groundnut, cotton,
                maize, bajra, wheat, sugarcane, and tobacco. </p>

            <h4>Flock Management and Breeding Practices</h4>

            <p>Farmers typically maintain small to medium-sized flocks, averaging around 30 sheep per flock. The sheep
                are primarily reared for meat production. Natural mating is common, with rams and ewes kept together.
                Rams are selected based on traits such as height at withers, body length, white coat color, short hair
                coat, and long ears.</p>

            <h4>Genetic Diversity</h4>

            <p>Studies using microsatellite markers have revealed a high level of genetic variation within the Yalaga
                sheep population, indicating a robust genetic pool. This diversity is crucial
                for the breed's adaptability and resilience.</p>

            <h4>Economic Significance</h4>

            <p>Yalaga sheep play a vital role in the livelihoods of local farmers, especially in regions with
                challenging agro-climatic conditions.
                Their ability to thrive on minimal inputs makes them a sustainable livestock option, contributing to the
                economic stability of marginal farmers. </p>
